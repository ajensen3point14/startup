# Elevator Pitch
In a complicated world with many moving parts, it is all to often that simple tasks slip our minds. 
With this simple Task Manager, tracking to-do lists becomes so much simpler. Being able to divide tasks among lists makes it easy to divide tasks
by day in the week, or subcategorize them by project. This Task Manager will allow users to create lists containing tasks, details, and subtasks
for all of their organizational needs. Being able to check each task off once complete will also bring the satisfying endorphins that accompany a
job well done. 

## Key Features
- List of task lists (with option to add new ones)
- Specific list section (with details on each task)
- Options: Delete completed tasks, rename list, delete list
- New task page: add name, description, time, repeat, subtasks

### JavaScript
This is a really powerful web dev tool. I like that it is pretty intuitive coming from a C and Java background,
and that it seems to rely on simple commands to make things work.

I really like that it makes user input comlete actions, and does so in a way that is easy to follow and debug if there are issues.

### Simon Service
I really like that this makes for an easy storage of scores. That it also displays scores by high score first instead of chronological order
is really useful.

### Simon DB
Atlas is a super useful method for creating Databases. This project also makes it very clear that the source files for things like database access will need
to be locked down super tight because they contain the credentials to access the database.
