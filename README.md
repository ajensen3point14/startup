# Elevator Pitch
In a complicated world with many moving parts, it is all to often that simple tasks slip our minds. 
With this simple Task Manager, tracking to-do lists becomes so much simpler. Being able to divide tasks among lists makes it easy to divide tasks
by day in the week, or subcategorize them by project. This Task Manager will allow users to create lists containing tasks, details, and subtasks
for all of their organizational needs. Being able to check each task off once complete will also bring the satisfying endorphins that accompany a
job well done. 

## Key Features
- List of task lists (with option to add new ones)
- Specific list section (with details on each task)
- Options: Delete completed tasks, rename list, delete list
- New task page: add name, description, time, repeat, subtasks
